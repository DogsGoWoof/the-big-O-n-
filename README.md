# the-big-O-n-


Based on [Big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) where finding a certain value within a range as a function of time.
Find _n_ using the help functions and make your best guess based on comparative probability. Fun for the whole family. Only fun with the whole family.

### How to play
Input area is for entering a `number` guess of what the `n-value` could be. The n-value is between the `min-value` (on the left) and the `max-value` (on the right). The player has __3 attempts__ before the game must be reset to play again.


Help buttons below:
    
- __High^vlow__: Compares the number entered in the `input` field to to n-value and returns whether it is higher or lower. Changes a range value.
- __EVEN+-oDd__: returns whether or not the n-value is even or odd.
- __max-min-ing__: subtracts the min-value from the max-value (max - min) and compares the result to n-value. Changes a range value.
- __div/iding e/nd__: divides the n-value by the min-value (n / min) and the max-value by the n-value (max / n) and compares results(ratios). Changes a range value (if there is a difference).

Each help button can only be used once per game.
